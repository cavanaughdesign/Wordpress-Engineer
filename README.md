## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Installation Issues

#### Python Version Issues

```bash
# Check Python version
python --version

# Should be 3.8 or higher
# If not, install Python 3.8+ from python.org
```

#### Virtual Environment Issues

```bash
# If venv creation fails
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install virtualenv

# Create virtual environment manually
python -m virtualenv venv

# Activate and install dependencies
# Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Dependency Installation Problems

```bash
# Clear pip cache and reinstall
pip cache purge
pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Install problematic packages individually
pip install anthropic==0.26.0
pip install sentence-transformers==2.2.2
pip install torch  # Required for sentence-transformers
```

### API Connection Issues

#### Anthropic API Issues

- **Invalid API Key**: Verify your API key at [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- **Rate Limiting**: Check your API usage and upgrade plan if needed
- **Network Issues**: Verify internet connection and firewall settings

net start mysql
# macOS:
brew services start mysql
# Linux:
sudo systemctl start mysql
```

#### SQLite Knowledge Database Issues

```bash
# Check if database file exists and is writable
ls -la wp_knowledge.db

# Reset knowledge database (will lose data)
rm wp_knowledge.db
python main.py  # Will recreate database
```

### Voice Input Issues

#### Microphone Access

- **Permissions**: Ensure microphone permissions are granted
- **Audio Drivers**: Update audio drivers and restart
- **Default Device**: Set correct microphone as default input device

#### Speech Recognition Problems

```bash
# Test speech recognition
python -c "import speech_recognition as sr; print('Speech recognition working')"

# Install alternative speech recognition backend
pip install pocketsphinx
```

### Web Interface Issues

#### Flask Server Problems

```bash
# Check if port 5000 is available
netstat -an | grep 5000

# Start Flask on different port
cd web
export FLASK_PORT=8080  # Linux/macOS
set FLASK_PORT=8080     # Windows
python app.py
```

#### Browser Compatibility

- **Modern Browser**: Use Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge (latest versions)
- **JavaScript**: Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- **Cookies**: Enable cookies for proper session management

### Performance Issues

#### High Memory Usage

```bash
# Monitor memory usage
python -c "import psutil; print(f'Memory: {psutil.virtual_memory().percent}%')"

# Reduce context window size in .env
MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS=100000
```

#### Slow Response Times

- **API Performance**: Check Anthropic API status
- **Local Processing**: Monitor CPU usage during operations
- **Database Optimization**: Run database optimization tools

### Getting Additional Help

#### Enable Debug Logging

```python
# Add to your .env file
FLASK_DEBUG=true
LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Or set in main.py
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

#### Log File Locations

- **Application Logs**: Check console output for detailed error messages
- **Web Interface Logs**: Flask logs appear in terminal when running web interface
- **Database Logs**: MySQL logs typically in `/var/log/mysql/` (Linux) or MySQL data directory
